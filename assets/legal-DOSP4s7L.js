## Privacy Policy

### Digital Sovereignty
Atlas is an open-source database engine and ORM. We believe in absolute digital sovereignty. This documentation site is statically generated and does not employ cookies, pixels, or trackers. Your exploration of our documentation is private and untracked.

### Zero Telemetry
The Atlas library and its associated tools contain zero telemetry. We do not collect "anonymous usage data" or phone home. Your database schemas, queries, and connection strings remain strictly within your infrastructure. Atlas is a tool for your application, not a probe for ours.

### Live Console & Sandbox
Interactions within the \`Live Console\` or technical playgrounds run exclusively within your browser's local sandbox or connect to ephemeral, logless demo instances. No data is persisted or audited by Gravito.
